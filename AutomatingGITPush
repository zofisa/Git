Write a simple bash script and save it on your home directory with git-push.sh


echo "Enter your message"
read message
git add .
git commit -m"${message}"
if [ -n "$(git status - porcelain)" ];
then
 echo "IT IS CLEAN"
else
 git status
 echo "Pushing data to remote server!!!"
 git push -u origin master
fi


Now, we will make this file an executable file by changing the permission using chmod command.
chmod +x git-push.sh
or
chmod 755 git-push.sh


Once the script is executable we will need to copy it to a directory that in our system expects to contain executable scripts and code.
On most systems we will have a choice between two directories. 
If we are the only user of our system you can copy our script to either /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.
If you share your system with other people it's best to copy your script to /usr/local/bin. 
You will most likely need super-user privileges to copy our script to either of these directories so most likely we need to use the sudo command.


sudo cp git-push.sh /usr/bin/git-push.sh
sudo cp git-push.sh /usr/local/bin


This will make our script accessible globally so that we can use it from anywhere and anytime we want.

Moreover, if you want to make push scheduled over particular time you can use crontab job scheduler to do so.
